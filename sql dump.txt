1. To find the percentage of airline passengers who are satisfied, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN Satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS satisfaction_percentage
FROM  airline;
```
To see if satisfaction varies by customer type or type of travel, you can use the following queries:
```sql
SELECT `Customer Type`, AVG(CASE WHEN Satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS satisfaction_percentage
FROM airline
GROUP BY `Customer Type`;

SELECT `Type of Travel`, AVG(CASE WHEN Satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 AS satisfaction_percentage
FROM airline
GROUP BY `Type of Travel`;
```

2. To find the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT `Gender`, `Age`, `Type of Travel`, `Class`, AVG(`Flight Distance`) AS avg_flight_distance
FROM airline
WHERE `Customer Type` = 'Returning'
GROUP BY `Gender`, `Age`, `Type of Travel`, `Class`;
```

3. To see if flight distance affects customer preferences or flight patterns, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(`Flight Distance`) AS avg_flight_distance, AVG(`Departure and Arrival Time Convenience`) AS avg_time_convenience, AVG(`Ease of Online Booking`) AS avg_ease_of_booking
FROM airline
GROUP BY `Type of Travel`;
```

4. To see which factors contribute to customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction the most, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(`Check-in Service`) AS avg_checkin_service, AVG(`Online Boarding`) AS avg_online_boarding, AVG(`On-board Service`) AS avg_onboard_service, AVG(`Seat Comfort`) AS avg_seat_comfort, AVG(`Cleanliness`) AS avg_cleanliness, AVG(`Food and Drink`) AS avg_food_and_drink, AVG(`In-flight Service`) AS avg_inflight_service, AVG(`In-flight Wifi Service`) AS avg_inflight_wifi_service, AVG(`In-flight Entertainment`) AS avg_inflight_entertainment, AVG(`Baggage Handling`) AS avg_baggage_handling
FROM airline
GROUP BY `Satisfaction`;
```
